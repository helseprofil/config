# geo folder
Files inside this folder will be used by **norgeo** package to alter geo codes
manually that were not handled properly by **norgeo**. This is especially
relevant for splitting geo codes. The files should be named as *geo-xxxx.R*
where *xxxx* refers to the geo granularity levels ie. *bydel, fylke, kommune* or
*grunnkrets* where the codes will be implemented. Input and output dataset must 
be named as **DT**.
