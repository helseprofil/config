# geo folder
Files inside the folder will be used by ***norgeo** package to alter geo codes
manually. This is especially relevant for splitting codes. The files should be
named as *geo-year.R* where *year* refers to the year of the geo codes. The
output of the file should be row index ie. row line number.
